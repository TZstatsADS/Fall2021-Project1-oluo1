### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Different Ideas and Characteristics Among Different Schools of Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by [Orianne Luo]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] This project seeks to understand the main characteristics that differentiate the different schools of philosophy. Starting with simple exploratory analysis of the data to identify these different schools and the philosophers of these different schools, the project then proceeds to look into the average sentence lengths among the different philosophers. From there, this project identifies the main topics of interest to these philosophers, as well as how they vary among the different schools of philosophy. Then, we take a closer look at three of these topics (Good, Nature, and True/Truth) to see how the different schools of philosophy have differnt views about these topics. Finally, this project explores the overall trends of the most common topics among philosophers over time.
